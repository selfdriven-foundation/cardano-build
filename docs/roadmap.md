# ROADMAP

## Scope
Update the current [Cardano.build](https://cardano.build) website for community-curated content by making it searchable, implementing "foot-hold" code examples, and adding support for developer collaboration and AI/GPT assistance.

### Key Objectives
1. Create a JSON representation of the resources at [Cardano.build](https://cardano.build).
2. Use the JSON representation to make the content searchable.
3. Develop a **Developer Collaboration App**, including a forum.
4. Enable **SSI (Self-Sovereign Identity)** functionality using the Cardano Blockchain, featuring "Logon Using DID."
5. Continue work on overview diagrams.
6. Curate resources into a "Cardano Curriculum," highlighting key features, short descriptions, and specific educational links.
7. Add **AI/GPT assistance** (e.g., a chatbot).
